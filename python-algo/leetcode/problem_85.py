"""85. Maximal Rectangle
https://leetcode.com/problems/maximal-rectangle/

Given a 2D binary matrix filled with 0's and 1's, find the largest rectangle
containing only 1's and return its area.

Example:

Input:
[
 ["1","0","1","0","0"],
 ["1","0","1","1","1"],
 ["1","1","1","1","1"],
 ["1","0","0","1","0"]
]
Output: 6
