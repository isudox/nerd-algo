"""392. Is Subsequence
https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/is-subsequence/

Given a string s and a string t, check if s is subsequence of t.

A subsequence of a string is a new string which is formed from the original
string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the
relative positions of the remaining characters.
(ie, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).

Follow up:
If there are lots of incoming S, say S1, S2, ... , Sk where k >= 1B,
and you want to check one by one to see if T has its subsequence.
In this scenario, how would you change your code?

Credits:
Special thanks to @pbrother for adding this problem and creating all test cases.

Example 1:

Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: true

Example 2:

Input: s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: false

Constraints:

0 <= s.length <= 100
0 <= t.length <= 10^4
Both strings consists only of lowercase characters.
