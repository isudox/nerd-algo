"""962. Maximum Width Ramp
https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-width-ramp/

Given an array A of integers, a ramp is a tuple (i, j) for which
i < j and A[i] <= A[j].  The width of such a ramp is j - i.

Find the maximum width of a ramp in A.  If one doesn't exist, return 0.



Example 1:

Input: [6,0,8,2,1,5]
Output: 4
Explanation:
The maximum width ramp is achieved at (i, j) = (1, 5): A[1] = 0 and A[5] = 5.

Example 2:

Input: [9,8,1,0,1,9,4,0,4,1]
Output: 7
Explanation:
The maximum width ramp is achieved at (i, j) = (2, 9): A[2] = 1 and A[9] = 1.

Note:

2 <= A.length <= 50000
0 <= A[i] <= 50000
