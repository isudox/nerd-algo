"""946. Validate Stack Sequences
https://leetcode.com/problems/validate-stack-sequences/

Given two sequences pushed and popped with distinct values,
return true if and only if this could have been the result of
a sequence of push and pop operations on an initially empty stack.

Example 1:

  Input: pushed = [1,2,3,4,5], popped = [4,5,3,2,1]
  Output: true
  Explanation: We might do the following sequence:
  push(1), push(2), push(3), push(4), pop() -> 4,
  push(5), pop() -> 5, pop() -> 3, pop() -> 2, pop() -> 1

Example 2:

  Input: pushed = [1,2,3,4,5], popped = [4,3,5,1,2]
  Output: false
  Explanation: 1 cannot be popped before 2.

Note:

  0 <= pushed.length == popped.length <= 1000
  0 <= pushed[i], popped[i] < 1000
  pushed is a permutation of popped.
  pushed and popped have distinct values.
