"""104. Maximum Depth of Binary Tree
https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-depth-of-binary-tree/

Given a binary tree, find its maximum depth.

The maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root
node down to the farthest leaf node.

Note:A leaf is a node with no children.

Example:

Given binary tree [3,9,20,null,null,15,7],

   3
  / \
 9  20
   /  \
  15   7

return its depth = 3.
