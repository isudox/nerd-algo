"""142. Linked List Cycle II
https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle-ii/

Given a linked list, return the node where the cycle begins.
If there is no cycle, return null.

To represent a cycle in the given linked list, we use an integer pos which
represents the position (0-indexed) in the linked list where tail connects to.
If pos is -1, then there is no cycle in the linked list.

Note: Do not modify the linked list.

Example 1:

Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: tail connects to node index 1
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the
second node.

Example 2:

Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
Output: tail connects to node index 0
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the
first node.

Example 3:

Input: head = [1], pos = -1
Output: no cycle
Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.

Can you solve it without using extra space?
