/**
 * 19. Remove Nth Node From End of List
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-nth-node-from-end-of-list/
 *
 * Given a linked list, remove the n-th node from the end of list and return
 * its head.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * Given linked list: 1->2->3->4->5, and n = 2.
 *
 * After removing the second node from the end, the linked list becomes 1->2->3->5.
 * Note:
 *
 * Given n will always be valid.
 *
 * Follow up:
 *
 * Could you do this in one pass?
