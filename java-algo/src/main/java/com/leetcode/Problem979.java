 * 979. Distribute Coins in Binary Tree
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/distribute-coins-in-binary-tree/
 *
 * Given the root of a binary tree with N nodes, each node in the tree has
 * node.val coins, and there are N coins total.
 *
 * In one move, we may choose two adjacent nodes and move one coin from one
 * node to another.
 * (The move may be from parent to child, or from child to parent.)
 *
 * Return the number of moves required to make every node have exactly one coin.
