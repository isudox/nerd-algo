/**
 * 964. Least Operators to Express Number
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/least-operators-to-express-number/
 *
 * Given a single positive integer x, we will write an expression of the form
 * x (op1) x (op2) x (op3) x ... where each operator op1, op2, etc.
 * is either addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division (+, -, *, or /).
 * For example, with x = 3, we might write 3 * 3 / 3 + 3 - 3 which is a value of 3.
 *
 * When writing such an expression, we adhere to the following conventions:
 *
 *   The division operator (/) returns rational numbers.
 *   There are no parentheses placed anywhere.
 *   We use the usual order of operations: multiplication and division happens
 *   before addition and subtraction.
 *   It's not allowed to use the unary negation operator (-).  For example,
 *   "x - x" is a valid expression as it only uses subtraction, but "-x + x" is
 *   not because it uses negation.
 *
 * We would like to write an expression with the least number of operators such
 * that the expression equals the given target.  Return the least number of
 * operators used.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: x = 3, target = 19
 * Output: 5
 * Explanation: 3 * 3 + 3 * 3 + 3 / 3.  The expression contains 5 operations.
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: x = 5, target = 501
 * Output: 8
 * Explanation: 5 * 5 * 5 * 5 - 5 * 5 * 5 + 5 / 5.  The expression contains 8 operations.
 *
 * Example 3:
 *
 * Input: x = 100, target = 100000000
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: 100 * 100 * 100 * 100.  The expression contains 3 operations.
 *
 * Note:
 *
 * 2 <= x <= 100
 * 1 <= target <= 2 * 10^8
