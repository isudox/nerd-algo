/**
 * 33. Search in Rotated Sorted Array
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array/
 * <p>
 * Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown
 * to you beforehand.
 * <p>
 * (i.e., [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]).
 * <p>
 * You are given a target value to search. If found in the array return its
 * index, otherwise return -1.
 * <p>
 * You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.
 * <p>
 * Your algorithm's runtime complexity must be in the order of O(log n).
 * <p>
 * Example 1:
 * <p>
 * Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
 * Output: 4
 * <p>
 * Example 2:
 * <p>
 * Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3
 * Output: -1
